## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Okay, i began with the html, i tried to do it the more semantical way posible and i leave the div about atribution of the project.

```html
  <main>
    <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png">
    <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
    <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
  </main>
```
If there is a better way to do it, ill be gratefull to hear.
```css
p{
    padding-left: 35px;
    padding-right: 35px;
}
```
And here i did the padding this way cause i didnt want that much space between this two components, again if you have suggestions ill hear them nicely. Also i didnt do it responsive.


### Continued development

I didnt feel confortable doing centering of the components, ill try to improve on how i write the css to make sure i wont go back on previous codes to make litle changes that may not change the result of the product.
